This chapter introduces an in-place algorithm for suffix sorting with linear time complexity[^in-place-sa-sort] (Optimal In-Place Suffix Sorting).

???+ warning "Warning"
    This chapter **only recommends** reading it if you are **very very familiar** with SA-IS[^nzc09a][^sa-is-intro] first.

## Global Settings

Target string $\texttt{Pat}$, suffix array $\texttt{SA}$, string indices start from 0, and the ending character is a sentinel, which can be set to 0.

## Suffix Sorting on Integer Alphabets

In fact, this part can be viewed as an in-place version of the SA-IS algorithm.

Because this is the algorithm with the clearest details in the original text and relatively simple implementation, as well as the foundation for understanding subsequent algorithms, it is the focus of this article.

The principle of in-place is to use the renamed $\texttt{Pat}$ instead of S/L buckets, using additional $O(n)$ operations instead of type buckets.

### Renaming Target String Pat

Simply put, we rename $\texttt{Pat}$ without changing the relative order of suffix sizes, and use the renamed $\texttt{Pat}$ to replace the original S/L buckets to indicate bucket heads or bucket tails.

The renaming method is to replace S-type characters in $\texttt{Pat}$ with the bucket tail index, and L-type characters with the bucket head index.

As shown in the figure below:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\texttt{Index}:\qquad&\texttt{ 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12} \\
\texttt{Pat}:\qquad&\texttt{ 2   1   1   3   3   1   1   3   3   1   2   1   0} \\
\texttt{Type}:\qquad&\texttt{ L   S   S   L   L   S   S   L   L   S   L   L   S} \\
\texttt{Bucket}:\qquad&\texttt{(0)}\texttt{ }\texttt{(1}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ 1 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ 1 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ 1 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ 1 }\texttt{ }
\texttt{ 1) }\texttt{(2 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ 2) }\texttt{(3}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ 3 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ 3 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ 3)}
\end{aligned}
$$

The renamed $\texttt{Pat'}$ (hereafter we will directly refer to the renamed $\texttt{Pat'}$ as $\texttt{Pat}$):

$$
\begin{aligned}
\texttt{Index}:\qquad&\texttt{ 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12} \\
\texttt{Pat'}:\qquad&\texttt{ 7   6   6   9   9   6   6   9   9   6   7   1   0}
\end{aligned}
$$

Since within a bucket, L-type character suffixes are smaller and serve as bucket heads; S-type character suffixes are larger and serve as bucket tails. Therefore, the relative order of suffix sizes is maintained.

Let's describe the specific steps of renaming:

1.  As in SA-IS, count each character in $\texttt{Pat}$ and compute its prefix sum (counting sort) to build S/L buckets, except here we use $\texttt{SA}$ to hold this prefix sum;
2.  Scan each character of $\texttt{Pat}$ from tail to head. This way, we only need to record the type of the previous character to dynamically determine the type of each character, and then rename it based on the prefix sum.

### Sorting LMS Characters

The key here is using an internal counter technique.

#### Initialization

Initially, set each item in $\texttt{SA}$ to E (EMPTY).

Scan $\texttt{Pat}$ from tail to head. If an LMS character $\texttt{Pat[i]}$ is found, then set the mark of $\texttt{SA[Pat[i]]}$:

If $\texttt{SA[Pat[i]]}$ is E, set it to U (UNIQUE);

If $\texttt{SA[Pat[i]]}$ is U, set it to M (MULTIPLE);

Other cases, do nothing.

The result is as shown in the figure below:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\texttt{Index}:\qquad&\texttt{ 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12} \\
\texttt{Pat}:\qquad&\texttt{ 7   6   6   9   9   6   6   9   9   6   7   1   0} \\
\texttt{LMS}:\qquad&\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ ∗ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ * }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ * }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ * } \\
\texttt{SA}:\qquad&\texttt{(}\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{U}}}\texttt{) }\texttt{(E)}\texttt{ }\texttt{(E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{M}}}\texttt{) }\texttt{(E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E) }\texttt{(E}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E)}
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Putting LMS Character Indices into SA

Scan $\texttt{Pat}$ from tail to head. For LMS character $\texttt{Pat[i]}$, classify and discuss according to the symbol of $\texttt{SA[Pat[i]]}$:

U: Directly set $\texttt{SA[Pat[i]] = i}$

M: Means there are at least two LMS characters in the bucket.

1.  If there are at least three LMS characters in the bucket:
    Use the second-to-last position in the bucket as a temporary counter to mark the number of filled LMS characters in the bucket (the last position in the bucket is the M flag).
    Insert new LMS characters starting from the third-to-last position, and increment the temporary counter by 1.
    If the bucket is found to be full, shift all elements from the bucket head to the third-to-last position to the right by 2 positions, then insert the new element at the second position in the bucket (the first position in the bucket is filled with E).

2.  If there are exactly 2 LMS characters in the bucket, obviously no counter is needed. Just insert from right to left in order.

Normal value:

    According to our earlier discussion, at this point, regardless of whether there are two or more than two LMS characters in the bucket, this means $\texttt{i}$ is the position of the last LMS character to be inserted in the bucket.
    We only need to scan from the bucket head to the left, find the first position marked as E, and set it to $\texttt{i}$.

Finally, scan through $\texttt{SA}$ from tail to head to clear any remaining special symbols M (since buckets are not fully filled, M and the counter are not overwritten).

The method is to shift LMS characters in the bucket 2 positions to the right as described above, and fill the vacated positions on the left with E.

As shown in the figure below:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\texttt{Index}:\qquad&\texttt{ }\texttt{ 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12} \\
\texttt{Pat}:\qquad&\texttt{ }\texttt{ 7   6   6   9   9   6   6   9   9   6   7   1   0} \\
\texttt{SA}:\qquad&\texttt{(}\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{12}}}\texttt{)}\texttt{ (E)}\texttt{ (E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ M}\texttt{) }\texttt{(E }\texttt{ }
\texttt{ E) }\texttt{(E}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E)}\\
\texttt{SA}:\qquad&\texttt{(12) }\texttt{(E)}\texttt{ (E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }
\texttt{ }\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{9}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\color{red}{\texttt{ 1 }}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }
{\color{red}{\texttt{M}}}\texttt{) }\texttt{(E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E) }\texttt{(E}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }
\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E)} \\
\texttt{SA}:\qquad&\texttt{(12) }\texttt{(E)}\texttt{ (E }\texttt{ }{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{5}}}}
\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\texttt{9}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\color{red}{\texttt{ 2 }}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }
{\color{red}{\texttt{M}}}\texttt{) }\texttt{(E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E) }\texttt{(E}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }
\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E)}\\
\texttt{SA}:\qquad&\texttt{(12) }\texttt{(E)}\texttt{ (}\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{1}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\texttt{ 5}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\texttt{9}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\color{red}{\texttt{ 3 }}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\color{red}{\texttt{M}}}\texttt{) }\texttt{(E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E) }\texttt{(E}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E)}\\
\texttt{SA}:\qquad&\texttt{(12) }\texttt{(E)}\texttt{ (}\texttt{E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }{\color{red}{\texttt{ 1 }}\texttt{ }{\texttt{ 5 }}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\texttt{9}}}\texttt{) }\texttt{(E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E) }\texttt{(E}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E)}
\end{aligned}
$$

This stage has $O(n)$ time complexity since each bucket is only moved and scanned once.

### Induced Sorting of LMS Substrings

#### Induced Sorting of LMS Prefixes

Perform induced sorting on LMS prefixes. As with SA-IS, this part is exactly the same as the induced sorting of suffixes later (using the same function), so we skip it directly.

The sorted result is given here directly:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\texttt{Index}:\qquad&\texttt{ }\texttt{ 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12} \\
\texttt{SA}:\qquad&\texttt{(12)}\texttt{(11)}\texttt{ (1 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ 5 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ 9 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ 2 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ 6}\texttt{) }\texttt{(10 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ 0) }\texttt{(4}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ 8 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ 3 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ 7)}
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Putting Sorted LMS Substrings into SA Tail

$$
\begin{aligned}
\texttt{Index}:\qquad&\texttt{ 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12} \\
\texttt{SA}:\qquad&\texttt{ }\texttt{E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{12}}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{1}}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{5}}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{9}}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Constructing the Reduced Sub-target String Pat1

Scan the LMS substrings at the tail of $\texttt{SA}$ from left to right to determine their size relationships and "rename" them. Store the renamed value of $\texttt{SA[i]}$ in $\texttt{SA}\left[\left\lfloor\frac{\texttt{SA}[i]}{2} \right\rfloor\right]$.

Since LMS characters are not adjacent, there won't be conflicts. This places the renamed values in the original order of the substrings they represent in $\texttt{Pat}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\texttt{Index}:\qquad&\texttt{ 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12} \\
\texttt{SA}:\qquad&\texttt{ }\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{1}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{1}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{2}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{0}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ 12 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ 1 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ 5 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ 9 }
\end{aligned}
$$

Then scan $\texttt{SA}$ and collect these renamed values to the head of $\texttt{SA}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\texttt{Index}:\qquad&\texttt{ 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12} \\
\texttt{SA}:\qquad&\texttt{ }\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{1}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{1}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{2}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{0}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ 12 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ 1 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ 5 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ 9 }
\end{aligned}
$$

### Solving Pat1 Recursively to Complete Sorting of LMS Suffixes

As with SA-IS, recursively solve the suffix sorting of $\texttt{Pat1}$ at the head of $\texttt{SA}$, and store the result at the tail of $\texttt{SA}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\texttt{Index}:\qquad&\texttt{ 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12} \\
\texttt{SA}:\qquad&\texttt{ }\texttt{1 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ 1 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ 2 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ 0 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{3}}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{0}}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{1}}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{2}}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Move the $\texttt{SA1}$ at the tail of $\texttt{SA}$ to the head of $\texttt{SA}$. Rescan $\texttt{Pat}$ from tail to head, and place the LMS characters in $\texttt{SA}$ in the order they appear in $\texttt{Pat}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\texttt{Index}:\qquad&\texttt{ 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12} \\
\texttt{SA}:\qquad&\texttt{ }{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{3}}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{0}}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{1}}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{2}}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{1}}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{5}}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{9}}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{12}}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

According to the "lookup table" at the tail of $\texttt{SA}$, restore the $\texttt{SA}$ at the head of $\texttt{SA1}$ to the index positions of the corresponding LMS suffixes in $\texttt{Pat}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\texttt{Index}:\qquad&\texttt{ 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12} \\
\texttt{SA}:\qquad&{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{12}}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{1}}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{5}}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{9}}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ 1 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ 5 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ 9 }\texttt{ 12 }
\end{aligned}
$$

Place the sorted LMS suffixes at the head of $\texttt{SA}$ into their corresponding buckets in order (starting from the tail):

$$
\begin{aligned}
\texttt{Index}:\qquad&\texttt{ }\texttt{ 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12} \\
\texttt{SA}:\qquad&\texttt{(}{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{12}}}}\texttt{)}\texttt{ }\texttt{(E)}\texttt{ (}\texttt{E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{1}}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{5}}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{9}}}}\texttt{)}\texttt{ }\texttt{(E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E) }\texttt{(E}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E)}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Induced Sorting of All Suffixes in Pat1

This part uses the internal counter technique used before to perform in-place induced sorting.

Suppose we already have sorted LMS suffixes (at the bucket tail) to induce L-type suffixes[^induced-order]:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\texttt{Index}:\qquad&\texttt{ }\texttt{ 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12} \\
\texttt{Pat}:\qquad&\texttt{ }\texttt{ 7   6   6   9   9   6   6   9   9   6   7   1   0} \\
\texttt{SA}:\qquad&\texttt{(12) }\texttt{(E)}\texttt{ (}\texttt{E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }{\texttt{ 1 }\texttt{ }{\texttt{ 5 }}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\texttt{9}}}\texttt{) }\texttt{(E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E) }\texttt{(E}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E)}
\end{aligned}
$$

As with sorting LMS characters, first count L-type characters using special symbols:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\texttt{Index}:\qquad&\texttt{ }\texttt{ 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12} \\
\texttt{Pat}:\qquad&\texttt{ }\texttt{ 7   6   6   9   9   6   6   9   9   6   7   1   0} \\
\texttt{SA}:\qquad&\texttt{(}{{\texttt{12}}}\texttt{)}\texttt{ }\texttt{(}{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{U}}}}\texttt{)}\texttt{ }\texttt{(E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ 1 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ 5 }\texttt{ }{\texttt{ 9}}\texttt{) }\texttt{(}{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{M}}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E) }\texttt{(}{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{M}}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E)}
\end{aligned}
$$

Scan SA from left to right. As with sorting LMS characters, the more complex part is determining the type of $\texttt{suf[SA[i] - 1]}$. We need to classify and discuss it (see the code for details):

$$
\begin{aligned}
\texttt{Index}:\qquad&\texttt{ }\texttt{ 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12} \\
\texttt{SA}:\qquad&\texttt{(}{\overrightarrow{\color{red}{\texttt{12}}}\texttt{)}\texttt{(}{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{11}}}}}\texttt{)}\texttt{  (E   E   1   5   9) (M   E) (M   E   E   E)}\\
\texttt{SA}:\qquad&\texttt{(}{\overrightarrow{\color{red}{\texttt{12}}}}\texttt{)}\texttt{  (E   E   1   5   9)}\texttt{(}{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{10}}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E)}\texttt{ (M   E   E   E)}\\
\texttt{SA}:\qquad&\texttt{(12)(11)}\texttt{  (E   E  }\texttt{ }\texttt{ } {\overrightarrow{\color{red}{\texttt{1}}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{  5   9)}\texttt{(10 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{0}}}}\texttt{)}\texttt{ (M   E   E   E)}\\
\texttt{SA}:\qquad&\texttt{(12)(11)}\texttt{  (E   E   1 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ } {\overrightarrow{\color{red}{\texttt{5}}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{  9)}\texttt{(10   0)}\texttt{ (}{\color{red}{\texttt{M   1}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{4}}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E)}\\
\texttt{SA}:\qquad&\texttt{(12)(11)}\texttt{  (E   E   1   5}\texttt{ }\texttt{ } {\overrightarrow{\color{red}{\texttt{9}}}}\texttt{)}\texttt{(10   0)}\texttt{ (}{\color{red}{\texttt{M   2}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ 4 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{8}}}}\texttt{)}\\
\texttt{SA}:\qquad&\texttt{(12)(11)}\texttt{  (E   E   1   5   9)(10   0)}\texttt{ (}{\overrightarrow{\color{red}{\texttt{4}}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ 8 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{3}}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ E}\texttt{)}\\
\texttt{SA}:\qquad&\texttt{(12)(11)}\texttt{  (E   E   1   5   9)(10   0)}\texttt{ (4 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\overrightarrow{\color{red}{\texttt{8}}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ 3 }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{7}}}}\texttt{)}
\end{aligned}
$$

Different from SA-IS, after induced sorting of one type of characters, we need to clean up LMS characters to avoid affecting subsequent in-place induced sorting:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\texttt{Index}:\qquad&\texttt{ }\texttt{ 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12} \\
\texttt{SA}:\qquad&\texttt{(12)(11)}\texttt{  (E   E  }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{E}}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{E}}}}\texttt{ }\texttt{ }\texttt{ }{\underline{\color{red}{\texttt{E}}}}\texttt{)}\texttt{(10   0)}\texttt{ (4   8   3   7)}
\end{aligned}
$$

As for inducing S suffixes from L suffixes, it is completely symmetric to inducing L suffixes from LMS suffixes. We won't give redundant introduction here.

At this point, induced sorting is complete.

#### Implementation

In terms of time performance, there is no significant difference from SA-IS. Space usage becomes less than $\frac{1}{3}$ of the original (code size increased by 1 times). It indeed lives up to the title "Optimal In-Place Suffix Sorting"[^in-place-sa-sort] of the original article.

## Suffix Sorting on Read-Only Integer Alphabets

Using complex methods to solve complex problems, using divide-and-conquer to solve the space constraint problem.

The difficulty in implementing the algorithm lies in constructing BitMaps[^np12] on $\texttt{SA}$ to replace the bucket head/tail positions originally indicated by the renamed T.

Here, BitMaps refer to bit vectors (bit vector) representing ordered multisets, which is a compact data structure (compact data structure).

Those interested can only read the original text and the BitMaps papers referenced in this article to learn more.

## Suffix Sorting on Read-Only General Alphabets

The prerequisite knowledge is merge sort and heap sort.

Since the author has questions about the time complexity of determining character types here, this will not be introduced. It is recommended to read the original text to learn more.
