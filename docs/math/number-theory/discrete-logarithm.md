## Definition

Prerequisite knowledge: [Orders and Primitive Roots](./primitive-root.md).

The definition of discrete logarithm is similar to logarithm. Take a positive integer modulus $m$ that has a primitive root, and let $g$ be one of its primitive roots. For an integer $a$ with $(a,m)=1$, we know there exists a unique integer $0\leq k<\varphi(m)$ such that

$$
g^k\equiv a\pmod m
$$

We call this $k$ the discrete logarithm of $a$ with base $g$ modulo $m$, denoted $k=\operatorname{ind}_g a$, which can be simplified to $\operatorname{ind} a$ when no confusion arises.

Obviously $\operatorname{ind}_g 1=0$, $\operatorname{ind}_g g=1$.

## Properties

The properties of discrete logarithm are also similar to logarithm in many ways.

???+ note "Properties"
    Let $g$ be a primitive root modulo $m$, $(a,m)=(b,m)=1$, then:
    
    1.  $\operatorname{ind}_g(ab)\equiv\operatorname{ind}_g a+\operatorname{ind}_g b\pmod{\varphi(m)}$
        
        Furthermore $(\forall n\in\mathbf{N}),~~\operatorname{ind}_g a^n\equiv n\operatorname{ind}_g a\pmod{\varphi(m)}$
    2.  If $g_1$ is also a primitive root modulo $m$, then $\operatorname{ind}_g a\equiv\operatorname{ind}_{g_1}a \cdot \operatorname{ind}_g g_1\pmod{\varphi(m)}$
    3.  $a\equiv b\pmod m\iff \operatorname{ind}_g a=\operatorname{ind}_g b$

???+ note "Proof"
    1.  $g^{\operatorname{ind}_g(ab)}\equiv ab\equiv g^{\operatorname{ind}_g a}g^{\operatorname{ind}_g b}\equiv g^{\operatorname{ind}_g a+\operatorname{ind}_g b}\pmod m$
    2.  Let $x=\operatorname{ind}_{g_1}a$, then $a\equiv g_1^x\pmod m$. Also let $y=\operatorname{ind}_g g_1$, then $g_1\equiv g^y\pmod m$.
        
        Thus $a\equiv g^{xy}\pmod m$, i.e., $\operatorname{ind}_g a\equiv xy\equiv\operatorname{ind}_{g_1}a \cdot \operatorname{ind}_g g_1\pmod{\varphi(m)}$
    3.  Note that:
        
        $$
        \begin{aligned}
            \operatorname{ind}_g a=\operatorname{ind}_g b&\iff \operatorname{ind}_g a\equiv\operatorname{ind}_g b\pmod{\varphi(m)}\\
            &\iff g^{\operatorname{ind}_g a}\equiv g^{\operatorname{ind}_g b}\pmod m\\
            &\iff a\equiv b\pmod m
        \end{aligned}
        $$

## Baby-Step Giant-Step Algorithm

Currently, there is still no polynomial-time classical algorithm for the discrete logarithm problem (the input size of the discrete logarithm problem is the number of bits of the input data). In cryptography, based on this point, many asymmetric encryption algorithms have been designed, such as [Ed25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA#Ed25519).

In competitive programming, BSGS (baby-step giant-step) is often used to solve the discrete logarithm problem. Formally, for $a,b,m\in\mathbf{Z}^+$, this algorithm can solve in $O(\sqrt{m})$ time:

$$
a^x \equiv b \pmod m
$$

where $a\perp m$. The solution $x$ satisfies $0 \le x < m$. (Note that $m$ is not necessarily prime)

### Algorithm Description

Let $x = A \left \lceil \sqrt m \right \rceil - B$, where $0\le A,B \le \left \lceil \sqrt m \right \rceil$, then we have $a^{A\left \lceil \sqrt m \right \rceil -B} \equiv b \pmod m$, after slightly rearranging, we have $a^{A\left \lceil \sqrt m \right \rceil} \equiv ba^B \pmod m$.

We know $a,b$, so we can first calculate all values of $ba^B$ on the right side, enumerate $B$, store them with `hash`/`map`, then calculate $a^{A\left \lceil \sqrt m \right \rceil}$ one by one, enumerate $A$, and check if there is a matching $ba^B$. Thus we can get all $x$, $x=A \left \lceil \sqrt m \right \rceil - B$.

Note that both $A,B$ are less than $\left \lceil \sqrt m \right \rceil$, so the time complexity is $\Theta\left (\sqrt m\right )$, and using `map` adds an extra $\log$.

??? note "Why require $a$ to be coprime with $m$?"
    Note that what we compute are $A,B$. We need to ensure that from $a^{A\left \lceil \sqrt m \right \rceil} \equiv ba^B \pmod m$ we can deduce $a^{A\left \lceil \sqrt m \right \rceil -B} \equiv b\pmod m$. The latter is obtained by dividing both sides by $a^B$, so we must have $a^B \perp m$, i.e., $a\perp m$.

## Extended BSGS Algorithm

For $a,b,m\in\mathbf{Z}^+$, solve:

$$
a^x\equiv b\pmod m
$$

where $a,m$ are not necessarily coprime.

When $(a, m)=1$, $a$ has an inverse modulo $m$, so BSGS can be used. So we try to make them coprime.

Specifically, let $d_1=(a, m)$. If $d_1\nmid b$, then the original equation has no solution. Otherwise, divide both sides of the equation by $d_1$:

$$
\frac{a}{d_1}\cdot a^{x-1}\equiv \frac{b}{d_1}\pmod{\frac{m}{d_1}}
$$

If $a$ and $\frac{m}{d_1}$ are still not coprime, divide again. Let $d_2=\left(a, \frac{m}{d_1}\right)$. If $d_2\nmid \frac{b}{d_1}$, then the equation has no solution; otherwise, divide both sides by $d_2$:

$$
\frac{a^2}{d_1d_2}\cdot a^{x-2}≡\frac{b}{d_1d_2} \pmod{\frac{m}{d_1d_2}}
$$

Similarly, keep judging until $a\perp \dfrac{m}{d_1d_2\cdots d_k}$.

Let $D=\prod_{i=1}^kd_i$, then the equation becomes:

$$
\frac{a^k}{D}\cdot a^{x-k}\equiv\frac{b}{D} \pmod{\frac{m}{D}}
$$

Since $a\perp\dfrac{m}{D}$, we deduce $\dfrac{a^k}{D}\perp \dfrac{m}{D}$. Thus $\dfrac{a^k}{D}$ has an inverse. Putting it on the right side, this becomes a regular BSGS problem. After solving $x-k$, add $k$ to get the solution to the original equation.

Note that the solution may be less than or equal to $k$, so before eliminating factors, do a $\Theta(k)$ enumeration, directly verify $a^i\equiv b \pmod m$, so this situation can be avoided.

## Fast Discrete Logarithm Based on Range Preprocessing

The previous BSGS algorithm has a time complexity of $O(\sqrt m)$ per query, which is inefficient when the number of queries is large. If the modulus for each solution is a fixed prime number $p$, we have a fast algorithm based on range preprocessing.

We already know $\operatorname{ind}_g(ab)\equiv\operatorname{ind}_g a+\operatorname{ind}_g b\pmod{p-1}$, so we can compute discrete logarithms for all prime numbers through the BSGS algorithm, and the discrete logarithm of a composite can be transformed into the sum of several known prime discrete logarithms through this formula. At this time, the complexity is still not optimal. We only preprocess part of the discrete logarithms. Specifically, we preprocess the discrete logarithms from $1$ to $L = \lfloor\sqrt p\rfloor + 1$. Note that the BSGS block length $B$ **cannot** be $O(\sqrt{L})$, because the preprocessing part of BSGS (inserting into the hash table) has complexity $O(B)$, and there are $O(\pi(L))$ queries in total. The total time complexity is $O\left(B+\dfrac{\pi(L)p}{B}\right)$. At this time, taking $B=O(\sqrt{\pi(L)p})$ is optimal. By the [Prime Number Theorem](./prime.md) $\pi(n)\sim\dfrac{n}{\log n}$, the total preprocessing time complexity can be balanced to $O\left(\dfrac{p^{3/4}}{\log^{1/2} p}\right)$.

Next is how to find the answer. Suppose we need to find $\operatorname{ind}_g y$. If $y\le L$, return directly. Otherwise, let $p=vy+r$, then $v=\left\lfloor\dfrac{p}{y}\right\rfloor<L$, $r=p\bmod y$, $y=\dfrac{p-r}{v}$, thus:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\operatorname{ind}_g y &\equiv \operatorname{ind}_g (p-r)-\operatorname{ind}_g v\\
&\equiv \operatorname{ind}_g (-r)-\operatorname{ind}_g v\\
&\equiv \operatorname{ind}_g (p-1)+\operatorname{ind}_g r-\operatorname{ind}_g v \pmod{p-1}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that $\operatorname{ind}_g (p-1)=(p-1)/2$, so we only need to recursively compute the discrete logarithm of $r$.

We can also consider another expression of $y$, noting that $p=vy+r=(v+1)y+r-y$, then $y=\dfrac{p-r+y}{v+1}$, thus:

$$
\operatorname{ind}_g y\equiv \operatorname{ind}_g (y-r)-\operatorname{ind}_g (v+1) \pmod{p-1}.
$$

We have $v+1 \le L$, so we only need to recursively compute the discrete logarithm of $y-r$.

Combining these two computation methods, we have $\min\{r,y-r\}\le \dfrac{y}{2}$, so recursively computing the smaller one can achieve $O(\log p)$ query complexity.

So far we have obtained an algorithm with time complexity $O\left(\dfrac{p^{3/4}}{\log^{1/2} p}\right)-O(\log p)$.
