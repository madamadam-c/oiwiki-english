## Introduction

The randomized incremental algorithm is an important algorithm in computational geometry. It does not require much theoretical background, has low time complexity, and applies to a wide range of problems.

The idea of the incremental algorithm is similar to ordinary mathematical induction. Its essence is to reduce a problem to a subproblem whose size is exactly one smaller, solve that subproblem, and then add the current object. Written as a recurrence:

$$
T(n)=T(n-1)+g(n)
$$

The incremental method has a concise form and can be applied to many geometry problems.

The incremental method is often combined with randomization to avoid worst-case behavior.

## Minimum Enclosing Circle Problem

### Statement

Given $n$ points on a plane, find a circle with the minimum radius that covers all points.

### Procedure

Suppose circle $O$ is the minimum enclosing circle of the first $i-1$ points. Add the $i$-th point. If it lies inside or on the circle, do nothing. Otherwise, the new minimum enclosing circle must pass through the $i$-th point.

Then use the $i$-th point as the base, with radius $0$, and repeat the above process while adding the $j$-th point in order. If the $j$-th point lies outside the circle, the minimum enclosing circle must pass through the $j$-th point.

Repeat the above steps. Since at most three points are needed to determine this minimum enclosing circle, repeat three times.

After all points have been traversed, the resulting circle is the minimum circle covering all points.

### Properties

**Time complexity**  $O(n)$. See the references for the proof.

**Space complexity**  $O(n)$
